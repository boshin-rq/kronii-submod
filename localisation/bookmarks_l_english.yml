 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 SPE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "LONG LIVE THE SOUTHERN EMPIRE! The Southern Player Empire was formed around 0148, shortly after the end of the first nether war. The Empire was formed solely for the protection of the overworld against the Nether, but as each year passes and no signs of any sort of nether activity, the empire has ever so slowly decreased in power over time. Over 7 years have passed since the nether invasion, but rumours are circulating that something has changed, and the Southern Player Empire must stay strong."
 PNH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "UNITED THE PIGLIN IS STRONG! Long ago the Elders speak of a treachery made against us by players from another world. We have long seeked revenge against this treachery, and we have learned much from the players that came so long ago. The portal is soon to be opened, and we shall unleash all hell onto those that live above."
 FKE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "LET THE WAYS OF OLD LIVE ON! The Kingdom of the east has lived on for Decades, growing to its height before the first nether war. But the ways of old are always slowly destroyed. After several corrupt kings and queens, the kingdom’s influence has rapidly declined over the last few decades. Now all they have grips on are a small few villages and growing raids from mobs. Will the Dynasty live on?"
 VN7_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "MONEY TALKS. but the desire for free will is stronger. The Villager Union is a brand new nation, giving villagers a chance to forge a stronger, more independent path from the players. However, we must tread our footsteps lightly, and control our hunger for power and stand by the players for a little longer."
 TUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "GRRR. When the players arrived, we did not stand a chance. They have pushed our species into the gaps of the overworld, filling us with hatred and seek for vengeance. Long have we been waiting for a sign of weakness and many of our allies believe the time is coming. We must sit in darkness and wait for our chance to prove ourselves. "
 OMN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "PRIMA LEGIONIS! For too long, the Players have dominated the overworld. For too long, their sinful ideas have plagued our world and guided us to a state of pitiful weakness. We are the Legion! Last year, the players may have discredited the Election result, but we will not stand by! We will fight! We will Fight to free all Illager Kind!"
 IMP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "KLAPPE ZU, AFFE TOT! Imperia has been a close relative of the Southern Player Empire since the very beginning. But as the Empire declined, so have we. and King Heinrich the 2nd No longer has the faith of the Imperian People. Revolution is Coming, but what can the King do to Change it?"
 ENH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "ARISE MY HORDE! Long ago the Elders speak of a treachery made against us by players from another world. We have long seeked to act revenge against this treachery, and we have learned much from the players that came so long ago. The portal is soon to be opened, and we shall unleash all hell onto those that live above."
