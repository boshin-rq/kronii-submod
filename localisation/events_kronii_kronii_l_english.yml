 \nMonsters don't deserve to live. They're weak and feeble, and partially primitive. We can take all of them on, we can colonize all of them, make use of them as free-labourers for the state, and make everything fun again.
 \n
 \nThe world is plagued by USELESS wars that don't achieve anything. The real enemies are infront of us, peko. We need to take them down. Now.

 \nVery unfortunate news!!
 \nRushia's house got exploded by TNT yesterday! Paramedics and first-responders couldn't locate the perpetrator, who is now wanted for arson! I hope they find her! This is very disastrous and I hope they catch the culprit.

 \nThis is false.
 \n
 \nMoona is alive and well.. There's nothing to be worried about, peko. Please continue your daily routines and support the PWP, Pekora Warcrime Party.

 kronii_kronii.8.d:0 "As world tension is flaring up, so is extremist ideologies.
 \nArguably one of the most prolific authors and politicians of [F11.GetName] is Usada Pekora, a figure that is being praised more and more in the mainstream now. Her violent actions that made her a fugitive are the same ones that are now being praised and supported more and more around the world. Free Villages have started demonstrations in public glorifying Pekora, whilst shaming her ex-partner in crime, Sakura Miko. 
 \n
 \nYesterday, in the [SPE.GetName], a player was executed for purchasing Pekora merchandise. This led many people flocking towards [F11.GetName] in herds, afraid that they will face similar consequences.
 \n
 \nAs the world progresses, only God knows when the oppression will stop."

 \nIt's about time we talk about the atrocities Usada Pekora has comitted!!!
 \n
 \nOne of our journalists, whom I will not name has been documenting Usada Pekora's actions in [F11.GetName]. What they saw was a number of player-atrocities and player-rights violations; exploiting worker conditions, paying in cash (very evil), unfair dismissals, murder, extortion, theft of employee belonging, home invasion, and the list goes on."

 kronii_kronii.11.d:0 "Recently, there has been a spike in interest about  Kronii Union, a newly formed state acting as a safehaven for Hololive Members. 
 \n
 \nSome countries do not recognise it as a legitimate state, since the country houses exiled members of the Saheritan Federation. The country was founded a year ago after the province, Old Kroneland was annexed. 
 \n
 \nA recent interview by Blockington Post revealed that players of Old Kroneland were subject to harsh torture and player-slavery by their villager counterpart. "

 \nAs a result of this, Moona will be awarded a purple peko-heart and a Pekorian Cross for her bravery in battle. "
