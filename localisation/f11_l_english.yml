 f11.event.1.t:0 "The History of the Kronii Union" #CHANGE CONTINENT NAME
f11.event.1.desc:0 "Kronii Union, or known as Old Kroneland was a region located in the south of the Sahertian Federation. Originally, it’d been filled with nothing but hopeless mercenaries and bounty hunters who were looking for work. It was arguably a dust bowl filled with power-hungry mercenaries who would kill just to survive. Due the volatility of the town, prominent names soon started appearing, like Usada Pekora and Jet Black. \n\nInitially, Pekora and Jet were great friends, even establishing their own autonomous state, however as time continued, cracks in their political views started showing. Jet Black was a devoted socialist, whilst Pekora wouldn’t have cared less if a starving child was shot in front of her. But when the First Nether War started and the country was pitted against their own rulers, Jet deserted the country and left Pekora to face her nightmares alone. Luckily, Pekora had friends who could assume leadership positions, and soon other local names started becoming political, joining Pekora in her fight. Of the many, the one that stood out most was Ouro Kronii, a public figure who’d been in the front-lines leading the charge against the Federation. Kronii earned her name in national headlines when she encircled dozens of Federation forces, freeing a local village. But the war still raged on, and even with Kronii’s professionalism, Old Kroneland was still in the grasp of the Federation. \n\nBy October 646, the Federation had controlled key provinces along Old Kroneland. Internal disputes and desertion plunged the town into chaos, and so Kronii made a move that shocked everyone, even Pekora. On a steamy night, Kronii sneaked out of her military tent and signed a peace-treaty with the Federation acting as Pekora’s advisor. When news broke out that Old Kroneland was to be assimilated peacefully, Kronii and Pekora ran southwards, settling in a nearby province, naming it New Kroneland. But it wasn’t a new version of the Old Kroneland. It was messy, hilly, and dusty. It’s name only served as a reminder of the failures of the old state, one which Pekora wanted to return to. But she couldn’t, because Kronii was elected as the leader, hailed as a ‘war hero’ for saving the country. Pekora thinks this is outrageous, and although she’s also been hailed as a hero, she wants more, because she knows she can get more."
 f11.event.1.a:0 "Cool, Kronii!"
 
 f11.event.2.t:0 "Kronii v Opposition"
 f11.event.2.desc:0 "As the political situation in the country gets worse, and more and more original subscribers leave the country, the nation is faced with a harsh reality. \n\nWhen Kronii first came to these lands, she established a council consisting of the former loyalists from Old Kroneland: Fauna, Pekora, Mumei, Mori, Haachama and Jet Black. At first they all supported each other in rebuilding the nation, however now that it’s nearing its completion, some have opt’ed to do their own thing and split away. Some fear that a repeat of the past will happen in this new nation. Recently, Jet left to Kronie Peak to preach about socialist ideals and became the local mayor, whilst Haachama and Mori fled down south to Port Village. After this, the remaining council members re-met at their last gathering which fell apart after Fauna argued with Kronii about Worker Rights, an issue that has affected the country deeply. Fauna believes that the safety laws Kronii has written are not enough, and that all workers should be paid an equal sum. This was the last straw for Kronii, who shortly kicked Fauna out of the council, leaving Pekora and Mumei as the remaining members. Although Kronii knows that she’s done bad things she can’t come to agreement with herself, and as such thinned her available council members, both of which have different political views than her. \n\nMumei wishes to ‘revitalize’ the country and ditch its traditionalistic values, instead returning to an agrarian village. In her view, the country can only progress if everyone’s helping each other out and being friendly to one and another. She believes that turning the country into one big villager states like her neighbours is the best course of action. \n\nPekora also wishes to revitalize the country, but in a different way. She believes the only course of action is to expand, enough that she can return to Old Kroneland and take down the Saheritan Federation. In her eyes, the only way the country can move forward is to commit player-atrocities and let ‘em know the rest. \n\nTensions have risen in the capital as people are finally understanding the volatility of the situation. One can only hope that the country can get through this power-struggle."
 f11.event.2.a:0 "Ouro oh."
 
 f11.event.3.t:0 "The Verdict"
 f11.event.3.desc:0 "Although having left the council, Mori is still loyal to her country and its wellbeing. When the Federation first invaded, Mori was a colonel who led soldiers on night-raids, thus familarising herself with stealth operations such as Coup d’etats. After Fauna’s public resignation, she alike others were shocked that Kronii could do such acts to her own country, and to her own friend. After a small catch-up with her friend Mumei, an apprentice of hers, Mori finally understood how grave the situation really was. This was the moment that Mori, a staunch friend of Kronii realised that Kronii was suffering from the burden of the country. The pair had been friends since the end of the war when Mori caught and allowed Kronii to slip out of her tent, arguably a move which saved thousands of lives. \n\nA day ago, Mori received a letter from Kronii urging her and Fauna to join back the council, assisting the current government in organising anti-revolutionary raids. She knew Fauna wouldn’t turn up, but how about herself? Could she come to terms with her country’s leader? Or perhaps she should support her apprentice who’s leading the revolution? As a popular personality with connections around the world, she has all the power in this situation. What path will she take?"
